# AJZane.com

My personal website: [AJZane.com][http://AJZane.com]

Run with `npm run serve`

Build with `npm run build`

The `app` directory holds all of the core assets that make the site

Icon font assets can be found in the `assets` directory. Use `selection.json` on the [icomoon app](https://icomoon.io/app/)


Run it with `npm start`. This will kick of an `http-server` that loads the website probably on localhost:8080
