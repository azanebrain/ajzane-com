# AJZane.com

My personal website: [AJZane.com][http://AJZane.com]

# Setup

Install all the necessary components with NPM

```
npm install
```

# Run

Run it locally with NPM:

```
npm start
```

This will start a localhost on port 8080.

# Deployment

???

I haven't gotten here yet

Old stuff:


The `app` directory holds all of the core assets that make the site

Icon font assets can be found in the `assets` directory. Use `selection.json` on the [icomoon app](https://icomoon.io/app/)


Run it with `npm start`. This will kick of an `http-server` that loads the website probably on localhost:8080
